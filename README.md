 Billboard Top 100 List to the Spotify Playlist.

In this project, I've aimed to add top 100 list for a certain date from the Billboard  to my Spotify Playlist. I reached songs and I created a playlist first the add all songs to playlist. I didnot use any module for authorization and also I did not use Spotipy modul. I've used OOP.
